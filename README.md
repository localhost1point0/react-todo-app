# React Todo App

This is a simple todo app built using ReactJS. It allows users to create new todos, mark them as complete, and delete them. All todos are saved to local storage and accessed from there every time the app is started, and any changes made to the todos are also saved to local storage o that they are accessible even after the user closes the app.

This app is hosted live on Github pages. To access the hosted app, visit the link: https://saragam443.github.io/react-todo-app
